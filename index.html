    The purpose of this project was to analyze how the weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analyssis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap
    API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
</p>
<p>After assembling the datset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs latittude. Factors we looked at included:
  temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and 
  visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and description of any trends
  and correlations witnessed.
